{{< accordion summary="What is this project about?" id="1" >}}

With so many more of us now working from home due to the Coronavirus outbreak, we thought it would be a fun idea to build a Hello card generator, to help you promote your remote events.

The idea is that you create a custom card, then share it with your friends on social media. Itâ€™s a bit of fun whilst weâ€™re all stuck at home.

Good question. That depends on whether you like it!

We have <a href="https://trello.com/b/DHO7G35Y/remotecards" target="_blank">a public roadmap</a> for what we have planned, including some of the features weâ€™d like to add. If you have any [suggestions](/#modal-suggestions), weâ€™d love to hear from you.

{{< accordion summary="Why canâ€™t I download my card?" id="4" >}}

If youâ€™re having trouble downloading your card on an IOS device, make sure you have Appleâ€™s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/files/id1232058109" target="_blank">Files</a> app installed before you download your card.

If youâ€™re on Android, weâ€™re sorry we havenâ€™t done any testing yet ðŸ™ˆ. But weâ€™re working on it.

If youâ€™re on a computer and youâ€™re still having issues, please contact <a href="mailto:harry@remote.cards" target="_blank">harry@remote.cards</a> or <a href="mailto:ben@remote.cards" target="_blank">ben@remote.cards</a> and weâ€™ll do our best to assist you.
